# Dot Race
This is a two player game where the goal is simply to collect more dots than your opponent! You can try this game with varying numbers of dots, three time options and gamespeed options.

## Controls
- The blue player uses the standard WASD keys to control the movement of his car.
- The red player uses the arrow keys to control the movement of his car.

## Technologies
This game is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used Mocha to test a few particularly complex methods, but otherwise it was just vanilla JS
